An attacker might be able to receive an address validation token (Section 8) from a server and then release the IP address it used to acquire that token. At a later time, the attacker can initiate a 0-RTT connection with a server by spoofing this same address, which might now address a different (victim) endpoint. The attacker can thus potentially cause the server to send an initial congestion window's worth of data towards the victim.

攻击者也许有能力在从服务器接收到地址验证令牌（详见[第8章]()）后释放掉它用于接收令牌的IP地址。一段时间后，攻击者可以伪造出相同的地址，并向服务器发起0-RTT连接，但这时该地址指向的会是另一个（受害者）终端。攻击者于是有机会令服务器向受害者发送多达一整个初始拥塞窗口的数据。

Servers SHOULD provide mitigations for this attack by limiting the usage and lifetime of address validation tokens; see Section 8.1.3.

服务器{{< req_level SHOULD >}}通过限制地址验证令牌的使用范围与有效期限的方式抵御此类攻击；详见[第8.1.3章]()。
