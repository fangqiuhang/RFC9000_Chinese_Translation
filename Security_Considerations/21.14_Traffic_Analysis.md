The length of QUIC packets can reveal information about the length of the content of those packets. The PADDING frame is provided so that endpoints have some ability to obscure the length of packet content; see Section 19.1.

QUIC数据包的长度会透露出有关这些数据包内容长度的信息。**填充帧**给予了终端混淆数据包内容长度的能力；详见[第19.1章]()。

Defeating traffic analysis is challenging and the subject of active research. Length is not the only way that information might leak. Endpoints might also reveal sensitive information through other side channels, such as the timing of packets.

对流量分析的防御是充满挑战的，并且是很多积极研究的主题。长度不是唯一会泄露信息的途径。终端还可能通过其他侧信道泄露敏感信息，例如数据包的计时侧信道。
