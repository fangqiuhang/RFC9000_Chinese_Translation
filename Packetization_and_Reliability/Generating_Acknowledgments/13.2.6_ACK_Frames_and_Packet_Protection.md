ACK frames MUST only be carried in a packet that has the same packet number space as the packet being acknowledged; see Section 12.1. For instance, packets that are protected with 1-RTT keys MUST be acknowledged in packets that are also protected with 1-RTT keys.

**ACK帧**{{< req_level MUST >}}被携带于一个和正在确认的数据包的数据包号空间相同的数据包中，详见[第12.1章]()。举个例子，受1-RTT密钥保护的数据包{{< req_level MUST >}}在同样被1-RTT密钥保护的数据包中被确认。

Packets that a client sends with 0-RTT packet protection MUST be acknowledged by the server in packets protected by 1-RTT keys. This can mean that the client is unable to use these acknowledgments if the server cryptographic handshake messages are delayed or lost. Note that the same limitation applies to other data sent by the server protected by the 1-RTT keys.

客户端发送的具有0-RTT数据包保护的数据包{{< req_level MUST >}}被服务器在受1-RTT密钥保护的数据包中确认。这意味着如果服务器的加密握手消息被延误或丢失，则客户端有可能无法使用这些确认。注意，相同的限制同样适用于服务器发送的受1-RTT密钥保护的其他数据。
