A packet MUST NOT be acknowledged until packet protection has been successfully removed and all frames contained in the packet have been processed. For STREAM frames, this means the data has been enqueued in preparation to be received by the application protocol, but it does not require that data be delivered and consumed.

在数据包保护被成功移除且所有包含在数据包中的帧都被处理之前，{{< req_level MUST_NOT >}}确认这个数据包。对于**流帧**，这个时机指其中的数据已经被置入队列，且准备被应用协议接收之时，但它不要求数据被分发和消费。

Once the packet has been fully processed, a receiver acknowledges receipt by sending one or more ACK frames containing the packet number of the received packet.

一旦数据包已经被完全处理，接收方通过发送一个或多个**ACK帧**来确认这个数据包的接收，这些**ACK帧**中包含被接收到的这个数据包的数据包号。

An endpoint SHOULD treat receipt of an acknowledgment for a packet it did not send as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION, if it is able to detect the condition. For further discussion of how this might be achieved, see Section 21.4.

如果终端有能力检测出收到了一个它未发送过的数据包的确认的情况，它{{< req_level SHOULD >}}将这种情况视作一种类型为`PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`（协议违背）的错误。有关如何做到这件事，详见[第21.4章]()。
