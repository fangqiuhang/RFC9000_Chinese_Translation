Path validation succeeds when a PATH_RESPONSE frame is received that contains the data that was sent in a previous PATH_CHALLENGE frame. A PATH_RESPONSE frame received on any network path validates the path on which the PATH_CHALLENGE was sent.

当接收到的**回复通道帧**包含着曾在**通道挑战帧**中发送的数据时，地址验证通过。在任何网络路径上接收到的**回复通道帧**所验证的路径都是发送**通道挑战帧**时使用的那条。

If an endpoint sends a PATH_CHALLENGE frame in a datagram that is not expanded to at least 1200 bytes and if the response to it validates the peer address, the path is validated but not the path MTU. As a result, the endpoint can now send more than three times the amount of data that has been received. However, the endpoint MUST initiate another path validation with an expanded datagram to verify that the path supports the required MTU.

如果终端在一个未扩充至至少1200字节的数据报中发送**通道挑战帧**，并且它的响应验证了对端地址，那么该路径就是验证通过的，但这不包括路径的MTU。于是，终端现在可以发送超过已接收数据量三倍的数据。然而，终端{{< req_level MUST >}}使用经扩充的数据包发起另一次路径验证，来验证这条路径支持所需的MTU。

Receipt of an acknowledgment for a packet containing a PATH_CHALLENGE frame is not adequate validation, since the acknowledgment can be spoofed by a malicious peer.

接收到对包含**通道挑战帧**的数据包的确认这一事实并不能作为合适的验证方法，因为确认可以是被恶意对端伪造出来的。
