An endpoint measures the delays intentionally introduced between the time the packet with the largest packet number is received and the time an acknowledgment is sent. The endpoint encodes this acknowledgment delay in the ACK Delay field of an ACK frame; see Section 19.3. This allows the receiver of the ACK frame to adjust for any intentional delays, which is important for getting a better estimate of the path RTT when acknowledgments are delayed.

从具有最大数据包号的数据包被接收到的那一刻起，到对于它的确认被发送时，这期间的时间会作为一个被有意引入的延迟而被终端测量。终端将这个确认延迟编码在**ACK帧**的ACK延迟字段，详见[第19.3章]()。这使得这个**ACK帧**的接收方能够获知这些有意引入的延迟并作出调整，当确认出现延误时这一调整对更好地评估路径RTT是很重要的。

A packet might be held in the OS kernel or elsewhere on the host before being processed. An endpoint MUST NOT include delays that it does not control when populating the ACK Delay field in an ACK frame. However, endpoints SHOULD include buffering delays caused by unavailability of decryption keys, since these delays can be large and are likely to be non-repeating.

在得到处理前，数据包可能被暂留在操作系统内核或主机的其他什么地方。在填写**ACK帧**的ACK延迟字段时，终端{{< req_level MUST_NOT >}}在值中包括不受它控制的延迟。然而，终端{{< req_level SHOULD >}}在值中包含由缺少解密密钥造成的缓存延迟，因为这些延迟可以变得很大，而且有可能是非重复出现的。

When the measured acknowledgment delay is larger than its max_ack_delay, an endpoint SHOULD report the measured delay. This information is especially useful during the handshake when delays might be large; see Section 13.2.1.

当测量到的确认延迟比`max_ack_delay`大时，终端{{< req_level SHOULD >}}报告这个测量到的延迟。这个信息在握手期间延迟可能会很大的情况下是特别有用的，详见[第13.2.1章]()。
