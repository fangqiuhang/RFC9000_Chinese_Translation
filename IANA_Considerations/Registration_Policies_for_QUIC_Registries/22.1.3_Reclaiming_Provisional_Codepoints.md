A request might be made to remove an unused provisional registration from the registry to reclaim space in a registry, or a portion of the registry (such as the 64-16383 range for codepoints that use variable-length encodings). This SHOULD be done only for the codepoints with the earliest recorded date, and entries that have been updated less than a year prior SHOULD NOT be reclaimed.

可以申请从注册表中移除一条未使用的临时注册项从而腾出注册表中的空间，也可以申请移除注册表的一块区域（例如从`64`至`16383`的范围，它们是使用了可变长度整型编码的码点）。该申请{{< req_level SHOULD >}}只从具有最早记录日期的码点开始进行，并且一年内曾被更新过的注册项{{< req_level SHOULD_NOT >}}被释放。

A request to remove a codepoint MUST be reviewed by the designated experts. The experts MUST attempt to determine whether the codepoint is still in use. Experts are advised to contact the listed contacts for the registration, plus as wide a set of protocol implementers as possible in order to determine whether any use of the codepoint is known. The experts are also advised to allow at least four weeks for responses.

对于移除码点的申请{{< req_level MUST >}}得到所指派的专家组的评审。专家组{{< req_level MUST >}}尝试判断该码点是否仍在使用中。专家组应该联系注册项中列出的联系方式，和尽可能多的协议实现方从而判断该码点是否仍有使用场景。专家组还应该拥有至少四周的时间用于做出答复。

If any use of the codepoints is identified by this search or a request to update the registration is made, the codepoint MUST NOT be reclaimed. Instead, the date on the registration is updated. A note might be added for the registration recording relevant information that was learned.

如果上文中查找使用场景的结果是认定该码点仍在使用，或出现了更新此注册项的申请，那么{{< req_level MUST_NOT >}}释放该码点。取而代之的是，注册表项的日期会被更新。可以为此注册项新增一条备注，记录在此过程中了解到的相关信息。

If no use of the codepoint was identified and no request was made to update the registration, the codepoint MAY be removed from the registry.

如果没有找到该码点的使用场景，并且没有出现更新此注册项的申请，那么该码点{{< req_level MAY >}}被移除出注册表。

This review and consultation process also applies to requests to change a provisional registration into a permanent registration, except that the goal is not to determine whether there is no use of the codepoint but to determine that the registration is an accurate representation of any deployed usage.

这种评审与商讨的过程还适用于将临时注册项变更为永久注册项的申请，只不过目标不是判断有没有该码点的使用场景，而是判断此注册项是否准确地表达了它在某一部署场景中的用途。
