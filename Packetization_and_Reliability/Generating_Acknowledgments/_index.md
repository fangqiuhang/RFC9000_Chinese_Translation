Endpoints acknowledge all packets they receive and process. However, only ack-eliciting packets cause an ACK frame to be sent within the maximum ack delay. Packets that are not ack-eliciting are only acknowledged when an ACK frame is sent for other reasons.

终端确认所有它们接收到和处理过的数据包。然而，只有ACK触发包会使得**ACK帧**在最大的确认延迟之内被发送。不触发ACK的数据包仅当有一个**ACK帧**出于其他原因被发送时才被确认。

When sending a packet for any reason, an endpoint SHOULD attempt to include an ACK frame if one has not been sent recently. Doing so helps with timely loss detection at the peer.

当出于任何原因发送数据包时，如果最近没有发送过**ACK帧**，那么终端{{< req_level SHOULD >}}尝试包含一个这种帧。这么做有助于对端进行及时的丢包检测。

In general, frequent feedback from a receiver improves loss and congestion response, but this has to be balanced against excessive load generated by a receiver that sends an ACK frame in response to every ack-eliciting packet. The guidance offered below seeks to strike this balance.

通常来说，如果一个接收方对每一个ACK触发包响应一个**ACK帧**，那么这些来自接收方的频繁反馈可以改善丢包和拥塞响应，但这必须与它产生的额外负载相平衡。下文提供的指导旨在取得这种平衡。
