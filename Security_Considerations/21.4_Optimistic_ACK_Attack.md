An endpoint that acknowledges packets it has not received might cause a congestion controller to permit sending at rates beyond what the network supports. An endpoint MAY skip packet numbers when sending packets to detect this behavior. An endpoint can then immediately close the connection with a connection error of type PROTOCOL_VIOLATION; see Section 10.2.

会对尚未接收到的数据包进行确认的终端可能使得拥塞控制器允许以超过网络所支持的速率进行发送。要检测此行为，终端{{< req_level MAY >}}在发送数据包时跳过某些数据包号。终端在检测到对端的此类行为后可以立即用类型为`PROTOCOL_VIOLATION`（协议违背）的连接错误来关闭连接；详见[第10.2章]()。
