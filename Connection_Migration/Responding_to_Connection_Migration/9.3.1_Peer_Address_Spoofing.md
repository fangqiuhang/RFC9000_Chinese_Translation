It is possible that a peer is spoofing its source address to cause an endpoint to send excessive amounts of data to an unwilling host. If the endpoint sends significantly more data than the spoofing peer, connection migration might be used to amplify the volume of data that an attacker can generate toward a victim.

对端有可能伪造它的源地址来使得终端向不愿意接收的主机发送过量数据。如果终端发送的数据量比正在伪造的对端发送的要多得多，那么连接迁移可能被用来放大攻击者能够向受害者发送的数据量。

As described in Section 9.3, an endpoint is required to validate a peer's new address to confirm the peer's possession of the new address. Until a peer's address is deemed valid, an endpoint limits the amount of data it sends to that address; see Section 8. In the absence of this limit, an endpoint risks being used for a denial-of-service attack against an unsuspecting victim.

如[第9.3章]()中所述，终端应该验证对端的新地址以确认对端在新地址上拥有处理能力。在对端的地址被认定为有效前，终端限制它向那个地址发送的数据量；详见[第8章]()。如果没有这个限制，终端就要承担被用于针对毫无戒备的受害者的拒绝服务攻击的风险。

If an endpoint skips validation of a peer address as described above, it does not need to limit its sending rate.

如果终端如上文一般跳过了对端地址验证，那么它就不需要限制它的发送速率。
