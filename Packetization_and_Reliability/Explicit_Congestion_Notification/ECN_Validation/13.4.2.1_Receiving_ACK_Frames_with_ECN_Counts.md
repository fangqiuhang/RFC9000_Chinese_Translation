Erroneous application of ECN-CE markings by the network can result in degraded connection performance. An endpoint that receives an ACK frame with ECN counts therefore validates the counts before using them. It performs this validation by comparing newly received counts against those from the last successfully processed ACK frame. Any increase in the ECN counts is validated based on the ECN markings that were applied to packets that are newly acknowledged in the ACK frame.

被网络错误地使用的`ECN-CE`标记会造成连接性能低下。因此接收到具有ECN计数的**ACK帧**的终端在使用前要验证它们。终端用比较新接收到的计数和那些在最近成功处理了的**ACK帧**中的计数的方法进行这项验证。任何在ECN计数上的增加都会被验证，这项验证基于被应用到最近在**ACK帧**中被确认的原始数据包上的ECN标记。

If an ACK frame newly acknowledges a packet that the endpoint sent with either the ECT(0) or ECT(1) codepoint set, ECN validation fails if the corresponding ECN counts are not present in the ACK frame. This check detects a network element that zeroes the ECN field or a peer that does not report ECN markings.

如果一个**ACK帧**最近确认了一个由终端发送的数据包且这个数据包被设置了`ECT(0)`或`ECT(1)`码点，同时相应的ECN计数并未在这个**ACK帧**中出现，那么ECN验证就会失败。这项检查能够检测出将ECN字段归零的网络元素或并不报告ECN标记的对端。

ECN validation also fails if the sum of the increase in ECT(0) and ECN-CE counts is less than the number of newly acknowledged packets that were originally sent with an ECT(0) marking. Similarly, ECN validation fails if the sum of the increases to ECT(1) and ECN-CE counts is less than the number of newly acknowledged packets sent with an ECT(1) marking. These checks can detect remarking of ECN-CE markings by the network.

如果`ECT(0)`计数和`ECN-CE`计数的增加量的总和小于被新确认的且发送时具有`ECT(0)`标记的数据包的数量，那么ECN验证也会失败。类似地，如果`ECT(1)`计数和`ECN-CE`计数的增加量的总和小于被新确认的且发送时具有`ECT(1)`标记的数据包的数量，那么ECN验证也会失败。这些检查可以检测网络重设`ECN-CE`标记的行为。

An endpoint could miss acknowledgments for a packet when ACK frames are lost. It is therefore possible for the total increase in ECT(0), ECT(1), and ECN-CE counts to be greater than the number of packets that are newly acknowledged by an ACK frame. This is why ECN counts are permitted to be larger than the total number of packets that are acknowledged.

在**ACK帧**有可能丢失的情况下，终端允许忽略对某个数据包的确认。因此`ECT(0)`、`ECT(1)`和`ECN-CE`的增加量的总和大于被一个**ACK帧**新确认的的数据包数量是有可能的。这就是为什么允许ECN计数大于被确认的数据包的总数。

Validating ECN counts from reordered ACK frames can result in failure. An endpoint MUST NOT fail ECN validation as a result of processing an ACK frame that does not increase the largest acknowledged packet number.

为经过重排序的**ACK帧**验证ECN计数，其结果是不准确的。终端{{< req_level MUST_NOT >}}因为处理一个没有增加最大已确认数据包号的**ACK帧**而将ECN验证结果记为失败。

ECN validation can fail if the received total count for either ECT(0) or ECT(1) exceeds the total number of packets sent with each corresponding ECT codepoint. In particular, validation will fail when an endpoint receives a non-zero ECN count corresponding to an ECT codepoint that it never applied. This check detects when packets are remarked to ECT(0) or ECT(1) in the network.

如果接收到的`ECT(0)`或`ECT(1)`中任意一个的总计数，超过了已发送的具有的相应`ECT`码点的数据包总数，ECN验证就会失败。特别是，当终端接收到一个非零的ECN计数但那个相应的`ECT`码点从未使用过，验证就应失败。这项检查可以检测网络重设数据包的`ECT(0)`和`ECT(1)`的行为。
