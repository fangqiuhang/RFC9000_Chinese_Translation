An endpoint can migrate a connection to a new local address by sending packets containing non-probing frames from that address.

终端可以通过从新的本地地址发送包含非探测帧的数据包的方式来迁移连接。

Each endpoint validates its peer's address during connection establishment. Therefore, a migrating endpoint can send to its peer knowing that the peer is willing to receive at the peer's current address. Thus, an endpoint can migrate to a new local address without first validating the peer's address.

每个终端都会在连接建立期间验证对端的地址。因此，正在迁移的终端可以在知道对端在其当前地址上愿意接收数据的前提下向对端发送数据。因此，终端不需要先验证对端的地址就可以迁移至新的本地地址。

To establish reachability on the new path, an endpoint initiates path validation (Section 8.2) on the new path. An endpoint MAY defer path validation until after a peer sends the next non-probing frame to its new address.

为了在新的路径上建立可达性，终端在新路径上发起路径验证（详见[第8.2章]()）。终端{{< req_level MAY >}}推迟路径验证，直到对端向它的新地址发送下一个非探测帧之时。

When migrating, the new path might not support the endpoint's current sending rate. Therefore, the endpoint resets its congestion controller and RTT estimate, as described in Section 9.4.

在迁移时，新路径可能不支持终端当前的发送速率。因此，终端如[第9.4章]()所描述的那样重置它的拥塞控制器和RTT预估。

The new path might not have the same ECN capability. Therefore, the endpoint validates ECN capability as described in Section 13.4.

新的路径可能不具有相同的ECN功能。因此，终端如[第13.4章]()所描述的那样验证ECN功能。
