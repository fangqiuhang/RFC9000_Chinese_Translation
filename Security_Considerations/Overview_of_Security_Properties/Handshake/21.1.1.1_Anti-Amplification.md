Address validation (Section 8) is used to verify that an entity that claims a given address is able to receive packets at that address. Address validation limits amplification attack targets to addresses for which an attacker can observe packets.

地址验证（详见[第8章]()）被用于验证声称位于某个地址的实体是否有在那个地址接收数据包的能力。对于一些地址，攻击者能够观测到发向这些地址的数据包，而地址验证能限制针对这些地址的放大攻击。

Prior to address validation, endpoints are limited in what they are able to send. Endpoints cannot send data toward an unvalidated address in excess of three times the data received from that address.

在完成地址验证前，终端在能够发送的数据量上会受到限制。终端向未经验证的地址发送的数据量不能超过从那个地址接收到的数据量的三倍。

> Note: The anti-amplification limit only applies when an endpoint responds to packets received from an unvalidated address. The anti-amplification limit does not apply to clients when establishing a new connection or when initiating connection migration.

> 注意：抗放大限制仅适用于终端对接收自未经验证地址的数据包进行响应的情况。抗放大限制不适用于客户端建立新连接或发起连接迁移的情况。
