The attacks commonly known as Slowloris [SLOWLORIS] try to keep many connections to the target endpoint open and hold them open as long as possible. These attacks can be executed against a QUIC endpoint by generating the minimum amount of activity necessary to avoid being closed for inactivity. This might involve sending small amounts of data, gradually opening flow control windows in order to control the sender rate, or manufacturing ACK frames that simulate a high loss rate.

通常被称为慢速连接攻击（详见《[SLOWLORIS]()》）的攻击方式会尝试打开许多与目标终端的连接并且尽可能长地维持它们。这类攻击可以通过进行最低限度的活动以避免连接因无活动而被关闭的方式攻击某个QUIC终端。其中可能还包含发送少量数据，逐渐打开流量控制窗口从而控制发送者的速率，以及制造能模拟高丢包率的**ACK帧**。

QUIC deployments SHOULD provide mitigations for the Slowloris attacks, such as increasing the maximum number of clients the server will allow, limiting the number of connections a single IP address is allowed to make, imposing restrictions on the minimum transfer speed a connection is allowed to have, and restricting the length of time an endpoint is allowed to stay connected.

QUIC部署{{< req_level SHOULD >}}针对慢速连接攻击提供抵御手段，例如扩大服务器允许的最大客户端数量、限制单个IP地址能够创建的连接数量、向连接所允许的最低传输速率施加限制，以及限制终端能够保持连接的时长。
